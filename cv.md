I am a third-year student of BSUIR and I am getting a degree in information systems and technologies in economics. My main goal is to get a knowledge in IT sphere and become successfull in programming.  I am  very talented in control and self-organization and can make a decision in a short time. I learn quickly and absorb information like a sponge. I have never oficially worked but this is in me short term.

 I studied the C ++ programming language at the university and am now working on learning Java, the second attracts me more.  Also I am currently actively learning JavaScript, HTML and CSS, because I found front-end development the most attractive for myself.

 I completed English courses at MSLU at the B-2 level and now I actively support the language with the help of various online lessons and literature.

I see my future directly in the field of front-end development.
