            <p>I am a third-year student of BSUIR and I am getting a degree in information systems and technologies 
                in economics. My main goal is to get a knowledge in IT sphere and become successfull in programming.
                  I am  very talented in control and self-organization and can make a decision in a short time. 
                  I learn quickly and absorb information like a sponge.
                 I have never oficially worked but this is in me short term.</p>
                 <p>I studied the C ++ programming language at the university and am now working on learning Java,
                      the second attracts me more.  Also I am currently actively learning JavaScript, HTML and CSS, 
                     because I found front-end development the most attractive for myself.</p>
                     <p>I completed English courses at MSLU at the B-2 level and now I actively support the language with the help 
                         of various online lessons and literature.</p>
                         <p>I see my future directly in the field of front-end development.</p>
